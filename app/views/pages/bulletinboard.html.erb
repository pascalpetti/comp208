<p> Unfortunately, I will be unable to make it back for the weekend, so this will actually be a video screening of last Sunday's session.  While this session will not be interactive, I have used professional filming equipment, and ensured that the video is high quality, and allows you to see me, the projector screen & the chalkboard, so it's as close to the real thing as you can get. For copyright reasons, I can only present the video in a controlled screening.  I am unable to distribute the video to individuals.</p>


													<p> Hope to see you there! </p>
